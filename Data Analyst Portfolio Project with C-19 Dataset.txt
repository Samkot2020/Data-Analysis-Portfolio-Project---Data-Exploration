Data Analyst Portfolio Project with C-19 Dataset 
[Source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM]


1.	SQL Data Exploration Project 1 of 4 (Data Exploration) 

  Steps 
1.	Download the dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (the dataset is downloaded on June 17-2022)
2.	Do some excel formatting 
3.	Two excel tables “CovidDeaths” and “CovidVaccination” are prepared and saved in downloads Folder. The file format is .xlsx not .csv
4.	Upload the two excel workbooks to SQL server and rename them as “CovidDeaths” and “CovidVaccination”
5.	Verif which table is which using SQL statements 
	Select * from PortfolioProject .. CovidDeaths
	Order by 3,4 
5.	Actual exploration of the data with SQL starts here
	a.	Select Data that We are going to be using  (the fields I am going to work with) 
	SQL : 
	Select location,date,total_cases,new_cases, total_deaths,population
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
	order by 1,2
	
	b.	Looking at Total Cases vs Total Death (Fatality Rate) – Shows likelihood of dying covid if you contract covid in ethiopia 
	Select location,date,total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
	where location like '%Ethiopia%'
	order by 1,2
	
	c.	Looking at total cases vs Population – shows what percentage of population got covid 
	Select location,date,total_cases, population, (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected 
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
	where location like '%Ethiopia%'
	order by 1,2

	d.	For future visualization let’s go from ethiopia to the world 
	Select location,date,total_cases, population, (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected 
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
	– – where location like '%Ethiopia%' (comment out)
	order by 1,2

	e.	Looking at countries with highest infection rate compared to population
	Select location,population, max(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentagePopulationInfected
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
	--where location like '%Ethiopia%'
	Group by location, population
	Order by PercentagePopulationInfected desc

	The output is right at June 26 the highest the infection got is 487,430 :  
	
	f.	Showing Countries with highest Death Count per Population 
	Select location, max(cast (total_deaths as bigint)) as TotalDeathCount
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
	--where location like '%Ethiopia%'
	Group by location
	Order by TotalDeathCount desc

		The above is the proof at June 26 total death in ethiopia reported to be 7,530
		
	g.	Global numbers (stopped at minute 50) 
	Select sum(new_cases) as totalcases, sum(cast (new_deaths as bigint)) as totaldeaths, sum(cast (new_deaths as bigint))/sum(new_cases)*100 as deathpercentage
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths 
	where continent is not null 
	--group by date
	Order by 1,2 
	
	h.	 Looking at Total Population vs. Vaccination 
	Select Dea.continent,Dea.location,Dea.population,Dea.date,Vac.new_vaccinations,sum (convert (bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) 
	over (partition by Dea.location order by Dea.location, Dea.date) as PeopleVaccinated 
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths as Dea
	Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccination as Vac
	on Dea.location = Vac.location
	and Dea.date = Vac.date
	where Dea.continent is not null
	Order by 2,3
	!! Verify with the Ethiopia data - released by the UN !!
	
	i.	Use CTE (Common Table Expression) to calculate the percentage of People vaccinated 
	With PopvsVac (continent, location, population, date, new_vaccination, PeopleVaccinated)
	 as
	 (
	 Select Dea.continent,Dea.location,Dea.population,Dea.date,Vac.new_vaccinations,sum (convert (bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) 
	over (partition by Dea.location order by Dea.location, Dea.date) as PeopleVaccinated 
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths as Dea
	Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccination as Vac
	on Dea.location = Vac.location
	and Dea.date = Vac.date
	where Dea.location like '%eth%'
	--where Dea.continent is not null 
	--Order by 2,3
	)
	Select *, (PeopleVaccinated/population)*100 
	from PopvsVac

	Verified, currently 19.55 % of the population is vaccinated in Ethiopia (googled)  

	j.	Temp table to get percentage of population Vaccinated 
	Drop table if exists #PercentagePopVaccinated 
	Create table #PercentagePopVaccinated 
	(
	continent nvarchar(255),
	location nvarchar(255),
	population numeric,
	Date datetime,
	new_vaccinations numeric, 
	PeopleVaccinated numeric
	)
	Insert into #PercentagePopVaccinated 
	Select Dea.continent,Dea.location,Dea.population, Dea.date,Vac.new_vaccinations,sum (convert (bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) 
	over (partition by Dea.location order by Dea.location, Dea.date) as PeopleVaccinated 
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths as Dea
	Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccination as Vac
	on Dea.location = Vac.location
	and Dea.date = Vac.date
	--where Dea.location like '%eth%'
	where Dea.continent is not null 
	--Order by 2,3
	Select *, (PeopleVaccinated/population)*100 
	from #PercentagePopVaccinated
	
	k.Creating view to store data for future visualization

	Create view PercentagePopulationVaccinated as 
	Select Dea.continent,Dea.location,Dea.population, Dea.date,Vac.new_vaccinations,sum (convert (bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) 
	over (partition by Dea.location order by Dea.location, Dea.date) as PeopleVaccinated 
	from PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths as Dea
	Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccination as Vac
	on Dea.location = Vac.location
	and Dea.date = Vac.date
	--where Dea.location like '%eth%'
	where Dea.continent is not null 
	--Order by 2,3
